      Hello there! I am Adrian, I am a Spanish photographer and traveler currently based in Tokyo, Japan.
      During the day I work as a software engineer but in my free time I love to explore new places and capture moments through my camera lens. I like to focus  on the beauty of urban environments, natural landscapes and live music events.
